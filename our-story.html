Over the years the show has become the UAE’s biggest inclusive event and each year grows in participants and creativity. New participants are encouraged to the stage each year as we develop the show content.</p>

A place where children and youths from the community can sign up to a variety of recreational classes and enjoy all that the Talent Hub has to offer.</p>
