Over the years the show has become the UAEâ€™s biggest inclusive event and each year grows in participants and creativity. New participants are encouraged to the stage each year as we develop the show content.</p>

A place where children and youths from the community can sign up to a variety of recreational classes and enjoy all that the Talent Hub has to offer.</p>
